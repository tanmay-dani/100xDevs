I have tried to replicate the landing page of Zerodha using CSS since its not possible only via HTML.
I learnt how to use <div> effectively along with certain styles like colour , font size , padding , color , background-color. I have tried to write it without following the video but instead learnt the concepts and tried through trial and error.
Another new concept I learnt was of Flex Box & I am using the same to achieve the nav bar on the page.

Added a snapshot of the page achieved.
